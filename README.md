# Big-Bruce

Big Bruce is a project designed for lonely people including but not only college students, elderly people and kids. With the distance sensor placed on its chest, Big Bruce can know you are coming to hug him and closes his arms. Arms have joint like 3D sculpture that can move 360 degrees with the stepper motors that they are connected to. An Elegoo UNO which is pretty similar to Arduino UNO was used.
